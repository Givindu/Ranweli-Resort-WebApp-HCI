# Ranweli-Resort-WebApp-HCI

As the 3rd year 2nd semester project, we have to identify an already existing website with much more usability issues. Then we had chosen a Sri Lankan hotel website (Ranweli Holiday Village) for redevelopment.

As a team, we all together identified usability issues using some user research techniques. After that, we build low-fidelity high-fidelity prototypes before doing further development.
